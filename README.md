Specter Hunter
Specter Hunter is a Pac-Man style game where the player navigates through a maze collecting pellets while avoiding ghosts. The game features a top-down view and allows the player to control Pac-Man using arrow keys or on-screen buttons on mobile devices.

Gameplay
The player must navigate through the maze while collecting pellets to increase their score. The game features four different types of pellets:

Normal Pellets: Adds 10 points to the score
Power Pellets: Adds 50 points to the score and allows Pac-Man to eat ghosts for a short time
Speed Pellets: Doubles Pac-Man's speed for a short time
Slowdown Pellets: Halves Pac-Man's speed for a short time
The player must avoid contact with the ghosts, who will attempt to collide with Pac-Man, causing the player to lose a life. The game ends when the player has lost all of their lives.

Future Improvements
Future improvements to the game could include:

Adding more levels with different mazes and enemy placements
Implementing a high score system to allow players to compete with each other for the highest score
Adding power-ups and collectibles to the game to provide additional challenges and rewards for the player
Creating different game modes, such as time trials or survival modes
Team Requirements
To improve the game over the next two months, the development team will need:

A game designer to help create new levels and game modes
A programmer to implement new features and improve gameplay mechanics
An artist to create new visual assets, including new maze designs and enemy sprites
A sound designer to create new sound effects and music for the game
